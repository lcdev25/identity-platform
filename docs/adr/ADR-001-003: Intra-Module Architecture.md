# ADR-001-003: Intra-Module Architecture

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2025-08-16
* **Context:** To ensure consistency, testability, and maintainability *within* each service, we need to adopt a standard internal architectural pattern. A simple layered architecture can lead to a blurring of lines between business logic and infrastructure code.
* **Decision:** Each service will follow the principles of **Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters)**. The core domain logic will be at the center, with no dependencies on external technologies. It will communicate with the outside world through well-defined "ports" (interfaces). "Adapters" will provide the concrete implementations for these ports (e.g., a Spring Web controller is an inbound adapter; a Postgres repository is an outbound adapter).
* **Consequences:**
    * **Positive:**
        * **Excellent Testability:** The core business logic can be tested in isolation, without needing a database or web server.
        * **Technology Agnostic:** The domain layer is decoupled from specific frameworks and infrastructure, making future technology swaps easier.
        * **Clear Separation of Concerns:** A clean and enforced separation between business rules and technical details.
    * **Negative / Trade-offs:**
        * **Potential for Boilerplate:** Can introduce more interfaces and data mapping (DTOs, domain objects) than simpler patterns.
        * **Learning Curve:** Requires developers to be familiar with the pattern and its principles.
